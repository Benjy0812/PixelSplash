# WallpaperSplash 🎨🖼️

A growing collection of beautiful, high-quality wallpapers sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). Organized by theme and curated for your screen's delight!

**Note:** All wallpaper *names* and folder organization are created by me, not the original photographers or artists.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `wallpapers/` – Medium-sized wallpapers (1920x1080)  
- `originals/` – Full-resolution versions (e.g. 5616x3744)  
- `phone/` – Optimized for mobile devices (1080x1920)

## 📐 Need a Different Size?

If you need help resizing a wallpaper to fit your device (phone, tablet, ultra-wide monitor, etc.), feel free to contact me! I'd be happy to help. 😊
